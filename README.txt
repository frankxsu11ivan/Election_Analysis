The Module 3 narritive of the analysis.
the scripting went relatively well although the challenge was not able to use python in Gitbash.
Print'Hello world' was effective and there alot of time was spent trying to debug.
overall analysis is to execute python to run, sort and calcutate values.then execute pyton to preform calculations on data structures.
the election results are read to text file (#in progress) and to the command line.
