Overview of Module 3

Module 3 is Python.

The focus to gain an understanding of Python scripts that read and extracted from CVS file 'election analysis'.
Mathematical operations are performed and decision statements for election results. 
Results are written to command line and election_results.txt file.

---Project Build Out of Election Analysis
	the re-submittal of Election analysis is named differently by design. Mod 3 instructions had the code developed in VSC. later modules have us use Jupiter Notebook. 
	i have used the tools that are taught to us and have used jupiter notebook as a debug tool and then saved as .py file. Next .py code is saved as main.py
	the second submittal was more effective in getting a working Mod 3 Challenge.
